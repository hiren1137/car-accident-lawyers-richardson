            <h2>Directory Purpose</h2>

            <p>
                Car Accident Lawyer Richardson (caraccidentlawyerrichardson.com)
                is an online directory that provides information about car
                accident lawyers and personal injury attorneys serving the
                Richardson, Texas area. Our purpose is to help users find and
                compare attorneys; we do not endorse, recommend, or guarantee
                any specific attorney or law firm.
            </p>

            <h2>Not Legal Advice</h2>

            <p>
                The information provided on this website is for general
                informational purposes only and should not be construed as legal
                advice. Every legal situation is unique, and the information
                provided here may not apply to your specific circumstances.
            </p>

                <strong
                    >If you need legal advice, you should consult directly with
                    a qualified attorney</strong
                > who can evaluate your specific situation. Do not rely on information
                from this website as a substitute for professional legal counsel.

            <h2>No Attorney-Client Relationship</h2>

            <p>
                Using this website or contacting us does not create an
                attorney-client relationship. An attorney-client relationship is
                only formed when you have signed an engagement letter or fee
                agreement with an attorney.
            </p>

            <h2>Accuracy of Information</h2>

            <p>
                While we make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of the
                information on this website, we cannot guarantee that all
                information is complete, accurate, or current. Attorney

                <li>Business hours</li>
                <li>Ratings and reviews</li>

                <li>Business status</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                ...may change without notice. We encourage you to verify all
                information directly with the attorney before making any
                decisions.
            </p>

            <h2>Third-Party Information</h2>

            <p>
                Much of the information in our directory is obtained from
                third-party sources, including public records, business
                listings, and review platforms. We do not independently verify
                this information and are not responsible for its accuracy.
            </p>

            <h2>No Endorsement or Recommendation</h2>

            <p>
                Inclusion of an attorney in our directory does not constitute an
                endorsement or recommendation. The order in which attorneys
                appear, including in "top" or "best" lists, is based on publicly
                available metrics such as review counts and ratings, not on our
                evaluation of attorney quality or suitability for your case.
            </p>

            <p>
                You are solely responsible for evaluating and selecting an
                attorney. We recommend:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Consulting with multiple attorneys before making a decision
                </li>
                <li>Verifying attorney credentials and bar standing</li>
                <li>Asking about relevant experience for your type of case</li>
                <li>
                    Understanding fee structures before signing any agreements
                </li>
                <li>Checking references and additional reviews</li>

                attorney's ability to achieve a particular outcome in your case.
                Past results do not guarantee future outcomes, and each legal
                case is unique.
